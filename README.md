# Overview

This project investigates content trends on two major streaming platforms: Netflix and Hulu, through exploratory data analysis (EDA). The analysis focuses on uncovering patterns and insights regarding the availability, duration, and distribution of movies and TV shows while diving into additional dimensions like seasonal and geographic trends. The analysis is enriched with visualizations created using Matplotlib to make findings intuitive and visually engaging.

## Key Areas of Exploration

1. **Content Availability Over Time**
   - Analyzed the release trends of movies and TV shows across different years to uncover historical growth and platform strategies.

2. **Duration Analysis**
   - Examined the length of content:
     - **Movies**: Measured in minutes.
     - **TV Shows**: Evaluated based on the number of seasons.
   - Identified patterns in average durations over the years for both platforms.

3. **Seasonal Trends**
   - Investigated release patterns across months and seasons to determine if platforms favor specific times of the year for releasing new content.

4. **Geographic Trends**
   - Explored the geographic distribution of releases, focusing on the representation of different countries in the platforms' content libraries.
   - Identified regions contributing the most to the platforms' catalogs and their release dynamics.

5. **Time-to-Release Analysis**
   - Analyzed the gap between the original release date of content and its availability on Netflix or Hulu.
   - Examined whether newer content is being onboarded faster or if older content dominates acquisitions.

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of streaming platform strategies using EDA and data visualization, offering actionable insights into content curation trends in the competitive streaming industry.
